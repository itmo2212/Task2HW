Create a Linux project to work on for me


Sure! Here's a project idea for you to work on in the Linux environment:

Project Name: System Resource Monitor

Project Description:
Develop a system resource monitoring tool for the Linux operating system. The tool should provide real-time information about CPU usage, memory usage, disk usage, and network activity. It should also have a user-friendly interface that displays these statistics in a visually appealing manner.

Project Requirements:

System Monitoring: Collect and display real-time information about the following system resources:

CPU Usage: Show the percentage of CPU usage by different processes and overall system usage.
Memory Usage: Display the amount of used and available memory, as well as the memory usage by different processes.
Disk Usage: Show the disk space occupied and available for different mounted partitions or directories.
Network Activity: Display network usage statistics, including incoming and outgoing data rates.
User Interface: Create a graphical user interface (GUI) to present the system resource information in an organized and visually appealing manner. Consider using popular GUI frameworks like GTK or Qt.

Customization Options: Allow users to customize the tool according to their preferences, such as choosing which system resources to monitor, setting update intervals, or configuring visual styles.

Historical Data: Provide a feature to log and display historical data for system resource usage, allowing users to analyze resource consumption trends over time.

Alerts and Notifications: Implement a mechanism to notify users when certain resource thresholds are exceeded. For example, users could receive a notification when CPU usage exceeds a specified limit.
